If you want to use these files. There are some commands you need to run first, which are specified in the "Real-time Ubuntu.pdf"

```
sudo -s
apt-get install rt-tests
apt-get install gnuplot
```

After download these files, I would suggest you put them in your home folder, which will make it easier to run. We need to use following command to make these files executable.

```
chmod +x <~ or your download folder>/cyclictest_run.sh
chmod +x <~ or your download folder>/cyclictest_plot.sh
```

To run these files, you need to do the following commands.

```
sudo –s #we need root permission
./cyclictest_run.sh 100000 > result
```

Wait for a few minutes. This command creates a file named “result” containing the testing result. Then,

```
./cyclictest_plot.sh result
```

This command visualizes your data and put it in result.png in your current directory. Go see it!

There are some results in ../test_results folder for you to see.
