If you want to use this file. There are some commands you need to run first, which are specified in the "Real-time Ubuntu.pdf"

After download these files, I would suggest you put them in your home folder, which will make it easier to run. We need to use following command to make these files executable.

chmod +x <~ or your download folder>/cyclictest_run.sh

chmod +x <~ or your download folder>/cyclictest_plot.sh
  
To run these files, you need to do the following commands.

sudo –s #we need root permission

./cyclictest_run.sh 100000 > result

Wait for a few minutes. This command creates a file named “result” containing the testing result. Then,

./cyclictest_plot.sh result

This command visualizes your data and put it in result.png in your current directory. Go see it!
