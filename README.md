# Real-time ubuntu

This work is done at the TREC lab under the supervision of Prof. Alexander Leonessa

Basically, it is about how to achieve real-time ubuntu. This is a requirement if you want to have real-time applications, e.g., ROS2, ROS+Orocos, ROS-Control. 

## How to use these files.

1. Read "Read-time ubuntu.pdf". There are some concepts about real-time for everyone, and some linux concepts mainly focused on ME students. Please skip the part you already know. When you achieve the part **"4.3 Install the kernel"**, you can move to  **install_guide folder**

2. 
    -> install lowlatency kernel

    -> install rt         kenel
    
    -> you really don't need to install xenomai kernel. But, still, you can do that if you want.
    
    After successfully installed a real-time kernel, you can test their performance. 

3. Move to the **test_files** folder and please read README.md
