# real-time-ubuntu

This work is done at the TREC lab under the supervision of Prof. Alexander Leonessa

Basically, it is about how to achieve real-time ubuntu. This is a requirement if you want to have real-time applications, e.g., ROS2, ROS+Orocos, ROS-Control. 

In "install_guide" folder, there might be something wrong about "-". If some command fails, just type the command as you see in your terminal. I don't know how that happens, but sometimes "-" can be different.
